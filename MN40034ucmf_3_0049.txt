INTRODUCTION

made above, and of the poetic works. This prose version
is contained as a part of religious miscellanies in two MSS.,
Vat. Reg. 501 (1) and Aurel. bibl. publ. 515 (174) (1), and
represents the original text which Tortarius used in making
his poetical version of all the Miracles,(3). According to
Manitius (Gesch. d. Lat. Lit. des MittelalterS, III, p. 877),
this prose version of the Miracles of Tortarius is also con-¹
tained in four other MSS, Vat. Reg. 456(4)‚ Paris. lat.
1768 Α (5), Paris. lat. 5511 (6), and Rothomag. bibl. publ.
U 115 (7). This is, however, an error, since the Miracles
contained in these MSS, as shown by the catalogues of
their contents, are not those by Tortarius but those written
by his precedessors Adrevaldus and Adelerius as their
contribution to the Abbey's record of the deeds of the Saint.

The poetic works have an entirely different tradition.
They are preserved complete in one MS. only, Vat. Reg.
1557, 011 which this edition is based. The Passio and the
Hynm, however, are contained also in Paris. lat. 11606,

sec. XII, ff. 147-152‚ for the collation of which we have
