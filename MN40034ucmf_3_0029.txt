INTRODUCTION

From this it would seem to follow, as wetinterpret the words,
that there weresix brothers in the family, that two of these
were killed ina feud, that two died some time after, and
that at the time of writing the letter only Rodulfus now ,
an elderly man, and the brother to whom he writes remained„
The second passage is Ep.,1V. 13-32; from this we leam
that Rodulfus had evidently reached a high position and
had been sent on -an important mission to the West.
Whether this mission is to be connected with the journey
referred to in Ep„ IX is doubtful. We are inclined to
connect it with another journey mentioned in Ep„ V. 1344.
Here clearly the writer is in Spain, and from vss. 55- 58
it rappears that hei rs at some monastery on the great pil-
grimage route to the romb of St. James.

There rs not sufficient evi idence to justify any definite
conclusion concerning the date of Tortarius' death This
has been put by de Certain (1), whose dating Manitius (z)
accepts, after 1122, on the ground that the Peter addressed
in Epistle X was Peter the Venerable‚ and that vss. 16-20,
mentioning a new honor conferred upon this Peter, refer
to his elevation to the abbacy of Cluny, which took place
in 1122. For other views‚ compare the Notae in Histoire
Litte'raire de la France, v. X, p. 88. ’
