show favor to your words ——and llove the gifts 01 a loyal tongue.
Your father was my best critic, a man greatly blessed in the virtue
and the learning 01 his son. When Ι say that you write charming
verses ancl that you mingle with their charm the useful also, in that
they win you friends, I am not flattering. Ι only grieve that we
could be together but a while. For, although to the view I
ama man, yet within Ι have a maiden's heart; I do not repay
ill with ill but, like the ass, I bear whatever is put upon my back.
You know my character and I am glad 'that you find me 01 ready

forge an loom, like a change from their habitual tasks. Change
is the law of nature ; the sky is not always clear, or breezes mild,
or harvests rich; only that which is divine persists the same, all

ostriches which cannot fly with their wings and digest iton as
easily as liquid food. The king and his train were gorgeously
arrayed; the gleam 01 their armour outshone the sun and the
tramping 01 their horses shook the ground. The city lies on a
river's bank, from which stretch green meadows, and has a harbor
whither ships from England and other islands 01 the West bring
in their warcs. As we were riding 11011001110110111101055051101111,
my horse, too eager for a drink‚ became bemired, and the more 1
tried to guide 1111111100, the deeper in he went, rising now on
