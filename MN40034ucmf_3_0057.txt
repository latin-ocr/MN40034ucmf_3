When these differences from the classical norm might
cause confusion we have put the classical spelling in a foot-
note. In indicating erasures in the MS. and letters in
erasure we have followed the practice of Ullman (v. VI of
this series, p. LII) and put withIn parentheses the letters
which 116 not in erasure : s0 in (li).(toris) there is an erasure
between the second and thnd letters, in (nont)...(is) there
is an erasure between the two words, and in (flnon)s only
the last letter is in erasure. Similarly, in designating illegi-
ble letters and the corrections of different hands we have
for the first 6116 put the letters which can be read within
parentheses5 using dots between the parentheses to designate
the illegible letters, and for the second case we have enclos-
ed within parentheses the writing of the first hand. For
