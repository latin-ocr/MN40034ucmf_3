INTRODUCTION

of the fact that the sentences are for the most part short
and simple, witha preference for parataxis rather than hy-
potaxis, all but impossible. Thus pronouns, interjections,
and introductory particles generally may stand ar the end
of the clause which they introduce: cf. Ep. I., 52, pur
leuet illustri cuilibet ut; 823 De Mem, VIII. 9, 29-20,

sugemus qued leupus studiosis sit breue semper l Cu7u3 Min, ,

448, uis iufeeee petri uiue uieleutus uli ; cf. for similar instances
Ep, Ill. 46-7, De Mem, V. 4, 178, VI. 12, 36,V11. 2, 162,
VIII. 7, 26, IX. 5, 12, Pasa, I. 83. So words which be-
long together in one clause may be put in different clauses ι
cf. De Mem, Vl. 12, 24, auulus et leuae eui redditura Neptunus
frusta uidere iuuet3 VIII. 8, 5-6, a Saturnine Marius dum
seditiose l Illuue persequitur, pilleus intuitum Ep, ΙΠ. 56.
Such violence toa natural order of words is explained, in
part 22 least, by the demands of the metrical form, but more
especially by the writer’s efforts to secure paramoeon, his
favorite figure of the seheeuatu ueeleeeueu, whether in the form
of rime, in his Leonine verses, or as assonanee (jingle).
Rime both in the hexameter and pentameter is the mle in
the Passio and in the Mhacles, but it is not employed with
the same regularity in the De Memorabilibus and Epistulae.
This difference may be due either to a development in the
author's style, since the Miracles, it would seem (cf. above,
p. XIII), were Tortarius' last work, or, more probably, to
the difference in the literary genre of his writings, the Passio
and Miracles, as poems of devotion and edification, deman-
clinga more ornate style. (1) This assonance, which is a
marked feature of our author's prose style also, is secured
by the usual means (2) :

A. By the use of the same stem com ounded wth different
prefixes or suffixes : cf. Ep, I. ²9·50› uhcluel'l...eures l aures claudit,·
