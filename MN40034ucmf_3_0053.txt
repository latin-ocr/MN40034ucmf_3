INTRODUCTION

loguesof Queen Christina's Library. Here under the sec-
tion (pp. 225-284) giving the MSS. in the Library of Alexan·
der Petau‚ the old and new numbers appear side by side,
and this doubling was carried into his printed text of the
year 1739. His third MS, Reginensis 1545 (1), is not inclu-
ded in the section of the printed work giving Petau's
MSS, but in the section under the heading Bibliotheca
Reginae Suecine.

For the poetic works of Rodulfus Tortarius we are
therefore dependent upon Vat. Reg. 1557( ). The MS. is
in parchment, of 181 fohos, size om. 200 >< 0.098, executed
in fine hands of the 12th century. It bears on its back
the earlier number 1640. It is a small and compact octavo
volume, written in one colunm; the very thickness of the
parchment is a guide to the dating. The absence of Gothic
influence in the characters precludes any suggestion of their
being much later than the century of Tortarius himself.
The titles and the initial letter of every second line are in

red ; the script itself is good Caroline minuscule of the 1zth
century, of a type peculiar to the scriptorium of Fleury‚
but the question of how many hands were working on the
MS. is still open. Pertz' statement (5) that with the Mi·
racula S. Benedicti ends that part of the MS. which is written
by one hand does not tell the whole truth. There is clear

(1) During what years our MS. held this number we have not been able to
determine.
