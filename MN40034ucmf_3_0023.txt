PREFACE

our author and of the conclusions which we have drawn ⁸

from his works. We have addeda bibliography of works
pertaining to Tortarius3 other works are cited in full in
the foot-notes.

There are many who have helped to make our rask
easier to whom we wish to express our thanks : to the De-
partment of Latin Language and Literature of the Universi-
ty of Chicago for their permission to Miss Schullian to
devote her year as Ryerson ’ Fellow of the University
in 1931-32 to this joint undertaking3 to the authorities of
the Libraries of Stockholm, Leyden, Geneva, Paris, and the
British Museum, who aided ⁴us in the search for MSS. which
we now know never existed, and of the Biblioteca Nazlonale
in Rome, who kindly gave us the advantage of its resources 3
to our fellow-workers in the Academy for their friendly co-
operarion, especially ro Mr. Wyllis E. Wright, Librarian of
the Academy andro Professor Albert W. Van Buten, Editor
of the Academy publications3 to Professor T. Athinson
Jenkins of the Depattment of Romance Languages and
Literarure of the University of Chicago, whose interest in
the Letters of Tortarius awakened the interest of the se-
nior collaborator, thus leading to this edition of the entire
corpus, and who has generously allowed us the use of his
unpublished transcription of Epistle V11; and to Professor
Frederick M. Carey of the University of Califomia at Los
Angeles, who, during his visit this year in Rome, has given
us ,without stint the benefit of his expert knowledge of the
MSS. of Fleury and who has solved for us a bothersome
problem connected with the MS. ¹tradition of our author.
