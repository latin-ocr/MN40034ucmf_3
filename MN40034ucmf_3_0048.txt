INTRODUCTION

provenience, some of which Tortarius doubtless found in a
glossaty: antitistem, «reply» (De Mem„ VI. 2, ιι), archige-
nes, «doctor» (Ep, V. 89), machia, «battle» (De Mem„ ΠΙ.
8, 28“; Ep.,y11. 168); there are rare words some 01 which
are not recognized, in the sense in which Tortarius ern-
ploys them, in our dictionaries: doctilogus(1), « eloquent»

(Min, 551), elegus, «wretched» (De Mena, VH 8, 28),
gerulus, «leader» (Ep, VH. 108), hiare, «to draw back»
(Pass. H. 67), lateralis, «wife» (Pass, Π. 366), mediastinus,
«mediator» (De Mem, Π. 6, 47); fimlly, there are words
which seem, to judge from their appearance later in the
vernaculars, to owe their origin to popular rather than to
literary sources: assistere, a to be present» (Pass, H. 115),
baiulus, «support» (Pass, Π. 6ο), girase, «to turn» (Ep,
111. 356), grandis (De Mem„ IV. 1, 67) and largus (De Mem,
IX. 1, 11) for magnas, anus for quidam (Min, 455), valere
for posse (Ep, IX, 39). Such words, however, are buta
small part 01 Tortarius' vocabulary. The bulk 01 this is,
of course, that of ecclesiastical Latin generally, but especi-
cally 01 such Christian poets as Prudentius and Venantius
Fortunatus, in whose works many of the rarest words used
by Tortarius are to be found; but there are borrowings
also from pagan poen, chiefly Vergil and Horace; 61.
