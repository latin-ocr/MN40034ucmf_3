did not allow the rules of grammar, which he surely knew,
to hinder his efforts to turn averse or secure stylistic adorn-
ment. How these efforts affected his word-order is shown
by the fact that when such introductory particles as at and
abi stand at the end of their clauses, they not only afford a
convenient ending for the pentameter, but often give a
rime with the syllable at the caesura3 cf. Ep, ΠΙ. 46, bara
anima farti statae serenas aaa· l sarapit3 so in Min, 448
quoted above (p. xxvr); De Mem.,V. 4, 178, Dicis ei, «salvam
debeo qaas atinam a. To the same causes also may have been
due some of the vagaries of syntax, especially the use of the
moods and tenses ; thus, in Hym, 134, ignaras quodfar fait
Cilleaias... Hercules rarat, grannnatical consistency may have
been sacrificed for the jingle; likewise tenses are shifted
fo metrical convenience or for rime in De Mem, Π. 4,
43, Lace triumpharit qaa dax aa< mare ragalim Pass¹ Orat,
67, qaae dicata saties at qaae mandavero diaer; Π. 158,

Caesar adire aelia sed retinere aequit; Ι. 3, 114. Or rare words
may be introduced: cf. De Mem, VII. z, 111, n' siaa
effrenes paga illos prandere aaran H. 1, 25, effrenas frenabat
habenas.

Similarly certain morphological peculiarities are evi-
dently to be explained on the ground of metrical conve·
nience, e. g., the use in the fifth foot of the pentameter of
the -a‘ ending in the Ablative Singular of nouns of the
3rd Declension (agai, saluti), and the regular use of syncopated
forms of past tenses of verbs (cognoram, sudasse) and 'of
diminutives in -calar (aaaaalas, mamylus), although these
syncopated forms represent also the normal development
of the spoken language. On the other hand, there is no
evidence of the influence of the spoken language in the
