INTRODUCTION

Memorabilia and Epistulae, and aPetayianus 1297 and
856 containing the Memorabilia. These entries were in
turn copied by Dubois (1) without verification. We are

now able, thanks to a communication (2) from Professor
Frederick M. Carey, to prove that the conclusion suggested
above is the proper one.

We know that the Library of Fleury was sacked in 1562
by the Huguenots, and the majority of its contents saved
from destruction by the intervention of Pierre Daniel of
Orle‘ans‚ who acquired most of the Library for himself.
On his death it passed to Paul Petau and jacques Bongars
of Paris, the former of whom in 1614 bequeathed his share
to his son Alexander. Some thirty years after this Queen
Christina of Sweden acquired through the efforts of her
librarian, Isaac Voss, the library of Alexander Petau, and
on her death in 1690 her MSS, which had been catalogued
by Montfaucon, were purchased fot the Vatican by Alexander
VHI. The original MS. of the catalogue of Alexander

Petau's Library, which he himself made in 1645 when he .

sold most of his MSS. to Queen Christina, is contained in a
MS. in Paris, Bibliotheque Nationale‚ Moreau 849, ff. 221-
, 146. In this catalogue there is only one entry under the
name of Rodulfus Tortarius. Since Montfaucon's cata-
logue of MSS. once belonging to Petau mentions the
poetic works only of TortariuS, and since Vat. Reg. 1557
contains marginal notes in the hand of Paul Petau, there
can be no doubt that the entry in Alexander's catalogue must
be this MS. Of the three MSS. mentioned in the printed
catalogue of Montfaucon, two namely‚ Petayianus 856
and 1297, may be explained by reference to Paris. lat. 15076,
which appears to be Montfaucon’s autograph of his cata-

(2) Under date of Apr. 14, 1555. The substance of his statement we have
embodied with his kind permission in our account.
