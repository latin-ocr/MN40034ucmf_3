INTRODUCTION

education of his time and not till later became a monle,
and this evidence has been accepted by earlier cri itics. 11
must be remembered however, that this informat' tion could
have been deduced by the writers of the epigrams from the
works of Tortarius, and that the epigrams 111 not necessarily
primary sources for his life.

From the references which Rodulfus makes to himself,
we leam his name (Ep., Π. 1 5 ΙΠ. 2;IV. 2;Mir.‚ 5 ; Hym.‚
5115 Pasa, 502, cf. Ep., Ι. 1), the fact that he wrote the
Epistulae, Passio, Hymn, and Miracles m which his name
is introduced, thel pace of his birth t(Ep., ΧΙ.51-51,) and
the fact that at some time during his life he made 1 journey
through Normandy andi v 1111 ted on that occasion the towns
of Caen and Bayeux (Ep., IX). There is finally a reference
in Ep., VII. 1-2 which shows clearly that he was forty-five
years old when he wrote that letter ; the letter unfortunately
cannot be dated with exactness (1). Ἴ

There are in addition three other references in the Let-
. ters which should be brought into the record of Tortariusss
life. The first of these is acryptic passage in Ep , XI. 25-30:

Insistunt fratres patris ulcisci quia manes
Hosteso agg tessi procubuere tui:

Restitit inde dias m eis, periit quia tetras,
Hocque duos quadro non lego nos numero,
Namque relicta tetras et adhuc erat, at modo restat

Sola dias, monas ultima iam properat.
