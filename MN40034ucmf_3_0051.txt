INTRODUCTION

Mauri, and a Hymn in Sapphics to the same Saint: this
is surely our Vat. Reg. 5557, 5Ι55 earlier number of which,
1640, has been crossed out on the back and is replaced by
the present 5557. The bollandists assume that Bosco (5)
in his edition of a portion of the Passio was using this MS. ;
Bosco (2), however, in explaining his failure to print the
Hymn‚ states that much of it is almost illegible because
of the age and thinness of the MS. ; this description would
seem to point rather to Paris. lat. 12606, where the Hymn
does have parts which are almost undecipherable, than to·
Vat. Reg. 55 57, where it is easily legible. The next printed
edition of any of the works of our author are the portions
contained in Mabillon (5), who mentions no MS. by number
but assigns the poetic works to a MS. formerly of Fleury,
in his day in the collection of Queen Christina, and seen at
Rome by the Bollandists. This again is Vat. Reg. 5557,
formerly 1640. The same MS. is cited by Lebeuf (4), and
Eugene de Certain (5) made the most complete investiga-

tion of it up to his time. In later catalogues and editions
it is always Vat. Reg. 5557 which is cited.

From this evidence it would seem to be clear that for
the complete poetic works of our author Vat. Reg. 5557
forms the sole MS. Montfaucon, however, in his Biblio-
theca Bibliothecarum‚ v. I, 5759, pp. 44, 82, mentions three
MSS. not cited before his time ‚aReg.134 ycontaining‘ the

acquaintance with the MS„ since in printing 5 few lines of Ep. IX (Hist. de l’Acad.
des Inscriptions et Refice-lettres, XXI, 1754, pp. 511-514) he used transcripts
made by M. La Cume de Salate-Palaye at Rome. Euganeae Certain (Bibl. de l’Ec.
des Chattes 5855, p. 495) inquired in vain for these transcripts at the libraties of
Paris where the notes of Sainte-Palaye are preserved.
