INTRODUCTION

used photostatic reproductions procured through the
kindness of H. Omont of the Bibliotheque National.
In addition, vss. 1-3, 25 3454, 417-418, 591-592‚ and 789-
790 of the Miraeles have been excerpted in the hand of Pe-
tavius on f. tv (3u) of Vnt. Reg. 592, with the remark
·«Rodulfus Tortarius, monachus circa annum 1180 qui
Gesta Miracula Patris Benedicti scripsit». His text agrees
With Reg. 1557 except in vs. 592, where canit stands in
place of notat, avariant which need not lead to the conclusion
that he was not using Reg. 1357· Finally in the library
of Orle'ans there is another MS„ Aurel. bibl. publ. 490-491
(270 bis), a Histoire Manuscrite de Saint-Benoit‚ bearing the
date 17²5 and compiled by Dom Chazal from a wealth of
material dealing with Fleury. This contains (.II‚ pp.
734737) uss 316-503 of the Passio, taken, according to a
marginal note at tlte beginning, from the Bibliotheca Floria-
censis edited by Bosco in 1605, and (v. II, pp. 748-752)
vss. 591-788 of the Miraeles, with the marginal note ¹« ex

MS. cod. Reg. Sueciae apud Bolland. ad diem 21 martii, ’

pag. 334». For this MS'. of Chazal we have used photo-
static reproductions procured through the kindness of A.
Bouvier of the Bibliotheque de la Ville d'Orle‘ans. A col-
lation of the readings of the verses quoted from the Mira-
cles with the readings of Vat. Reg. 1357 shows that the
Codex Reg. Sueciae referred to by Chazal is to be identified
With out Vat. Reg. 1557.

Our earliest reference by number to a MS. of the poetic

works of Tortarius is that by the Bollandists (1), in their
edition of portions of the Miraeles and Passio They men·
tion an old MS. of the Queen of Sweden, no. 1640, contain-
ing the poetic version of the Miraeles, nine books of the De
mirabilibus, eleven Letters‚ the Acta Vitae et Martyrii S.
