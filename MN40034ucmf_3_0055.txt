XXXVIII
INTRODUCTION

dently an elogium of St. Bernard. It is on its verso that the
two epigrams on Rodulfus are found, half-way down the
page, the first by Francus Beatus the second by an anony-
mous author. They too are not entirely legible; another
folio of extraneous material follows, and it Is only with f. 3
that the works proper of Rodulfus Tortarius begin. The
MS. contains all the poetical works that we haye by his
hand; of these only two are found elsewhere the Passio
B. Mauri and the Hymnus in eius honore, contained also
as already noted in Paris. lat. 12606. The works of Rodul-
fus continue from f. 5t0f.178v. In addition, in f. zyv
is interpolated the epitaph on Abelard (cf. above); f. 179
contains an 11-line elogium of Peter Venerabilis3 ff. 179v-
181, an elogium of Cluny. The last leaf has anotesigned by
one Ο. Lecamuss to the effect that he had come to a certain
place on Sept. 15, 1500. The note is in old French and
suggests that the MS. was in French hands at the time:
« Je soubz-signe' suys venu ce ans le XVe jour de septembre
lan de grace mil cinq cens 1500 >>. Fleury was not sacked by
the Huguenots until 1562, and it is possible that Lecamuss
may haye recorded in this way his consultation of the MS.
while it was still in the Library of Fleury. That it was
later owned by Paul Petau is proved by the captions « Ro-
dulphi Monachi Memorabilium Libri IX» and « Rodulphi
Tortarii Epistulae» written in his own hand at the top of
f. 3 and f. 1043 by the following marginal notes: on Ep„
Ι. 2, ‹< in Passione B. Mauri in f. » ; on Ep„ X. 17 « Abbas
Claraev. »; on Pass. Π, 316, «Excusa haec vsunt in Flo-

riac. Bibliotheca p. 349 », where the reference is to Bosco's
edition of 1605 ;on Pass, ΙΙ. 502, «Expl. in pr. » correspon-
ding to the note on Ep,- I. 2; on Hym, 306, «Hinc sat con-

stat Rodulfum Tortarium monachum fuisse Floriacensem»;
and on Min, 789, «Habentur in libro cui titulusque Flo-
riacensis Bibliotheca p. 149», where the reference is again
