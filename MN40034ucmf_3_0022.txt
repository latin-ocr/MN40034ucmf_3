> PREFACE

In publishing this first edition of the poetic works
of Rodulfus Tortarius we wish to express our deep gratitude
to the authorities of the Vatican Library, whose generosity
in placing the unique MS. at our disposal and whose helpful
cooperation have made the· publication possible.

Since the MS. was written, if not during the author's
lifetime‚ at least a few years after his death, we have printed
it as it was written, expanding, however, the abbreviations
and adding capitalization and punctuation.v The very
inconsistencies in the spelling of words may throw some ι
light upon the development in the pronunciation of the
spoken language. In cases where the spelling results in
ambiguity we have given the classical equivalent in a foor- ,
note. 'The remarkable correctness of the text has overcome
any desire on our part to make difficult passages simpler'
by emendation, and only in rare cases have we dared to
correct what seems to bean error of the copyist. Nor
have we tried to fill in the numerous lacunae, except in a
few cases where the missing word or words seem fairly
obvious, since such an endeavor is simply a game of chance
in which one¹ guess may be as good as another.
⁴ The numerous problems, textual, linguistic, lherary,
and historical, which have resulted from the study of our
author we have tried ro suggest in our Introduction. The
limitation of size has prevented in most cases anything
more than a suggestion and has led us to make our Intro-
duction little more than a summary, with appropriate
references, of what is known or has been conjectured about
