Some of these and similar variations from ciassical
usage are those which were characteristic of the more
informal Latin, e. g, the frequent use of the Present
tense for the Future, of the imperfect subjunctive with-
out force as a Potential or Unreai of the Present (cf.
De Mem„ VI. 4, ιο), of the Indicative in indirect Ques-
tions, of clauses introduced by qood and qaia as objects
of oerho reotr'eodr' et declarandi3 both the Indicative and
subjunctive are used in these clauses and how rhetoric
rather than psychology influenced the choice of particle
and mood is shown by Pass, ΙΙ. 240, iorrr cognosce miser,
