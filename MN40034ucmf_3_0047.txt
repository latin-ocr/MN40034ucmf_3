INTRODUCTION

Perfect (1); clenrly substantive is aelle ns the object of
deprehendo (Ep, VII. 387), sequor (ΕΡ, X. 93), pene (Ep,

X. 97); so we find pre aelle (De Mein, I. 3, 117), eontra
nelle (ΕΡ, X. 93), end aelle ipram (En, V. 77).

In the syntex of the noun notewortby is the preference
for prepositional phrases instead of a simple Ablative3
thus, Means is expressed by the Abl. with ab (En, IX. 210),
with eam (De Mem, IX. 11, 36), with de (De Mem, II.
1, 1543 Ep„ II. 51); there is one example of what seems
to be a Nominative Absolute (Pass, H. 116). In this
matter also rhetoric may have had influenee ; it is doubtful,
for example, whether the use ofin with the Ablative instead
of the Accusative in such a line ns Min, 243, sexta nero die
saera delatus in‘aede, represents the loss of distinction between
these two cases, or whether the Abletive is not used rather
for the sake of the rime ; cf. the contrary cese in De Mem„
VIII. 18, 22-5, in que Romane spes erit imperio ἵ l Respiciens
Marium dux Scinio dixit, «ie eptem».

In the use of the pronouns there is, ns in late Latin
generally, a lach of· distinction among the Demonstratives;
thus, ipse and iste are used for is or bic, idem for id or hee,
is for the IndIrect Reflexive (De Mem, IX. 5, 4), and the
Reflexives sibi end se are commonly used without reflexive
force ; t0 be noted is the tendency to restrict sear, when not
reflexiye, to refer to a singular possessor only ( ).

The vocabulary of Tortarius is as artificial as his syntax.
There are archaic wordS, used often from metrical necessity,
as induperator for imperator, the adverb oppido, the interjection
papae (ΕΡ, VI. 224); there are wordS, ultimately of Greek

des mseriptions latines de la Caute, Brussels, 1901, 203, and in official documents
of the Metoyingian period, cf. Vielliard, Le Latin des Diplbmes et Chanes dcl’E-
